## Reflection

This app is being built with the intent to get me back into my photography hobby. I want to be able to find vista points or amazing photography locations to capture on my mirrorless camera or to just simply soak up the moment.

I'm setting up to build something similar to TripAdvisor where people can drop interesting locations for others to see.
